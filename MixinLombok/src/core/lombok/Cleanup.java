/**
 * Ensures the variable declaration that you annotate will be cleaned up by calling its close method, regardless
 * of what happens. Implemented by wrapping all statements following the local variable declaration to the
 * end of your scope into a try block that, as a finally action, closes the resource.
 * <p>
 * Complete documentation is found at <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/Cleanup.html">the project lombok features page for &#64;Cleanup</a>.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * public void copyFile(String in, String out) throws IOException {
 *     &#64;Cleanup FileInputStream inStream = new FileInputStream(in);
 *     &#64;Cleanup FileOutputStream outStream = new FileOutputStream(out);
 *     byte[] b = new byte[65536];
 *     while (true) {
 *         int r = inStream.read(b);
 *         if (r == -1) break;
 *         outStream.write(b, 0, r);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Will generate:
 * <pre>
 * public void copyFile(String in, String out) throws IOException {
 *     &#64;Cleanup FileInputStream inStream = new FileInputStream(in);
 *     try {
 *         &#64;Cleanup FileOutputStream outStream = new FileOutputStream(out);
 *         try {
 *             byte[] b = new byte[65536];
 *             while (true) {
 *                 int r = inStream.read(b);
 *                 if (r == -1) break;
 *                 outStream.write(b, 0, r);
 *             }
 *         } finally {
 *             if (out != null) out.close();
 *         }
 *     } finally {
 *         if (in != null) in.close();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>

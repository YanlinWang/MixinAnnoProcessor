/**
 * Put on any field to make lombok build a standard setter.
 * <p>
 * Complete documentation is found at <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter.html">the project lombok features page for &#64;Getter and &#64;Setter</a>.
 * <p>
 * Even though it is not listed, this annotation also has the {@code onParam} and {@code onMethod} parameter. See the full documentation for more details.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 *     private &#64;Setter int foo;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * will generate:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *     public void setFoo(int foo) {
 *         this.foo = foo;
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This annotation can also be applied to a class, in which case it'll be as if all non-static fields that don't already have
 * a {@code Setter} annotation have the annotation.

/**
 * &#64;SneakyThrow will avoid javac's insistence that you either catch or throw onward any checked exceptions that
 * statements in your method body declare they generate.
 * <p>
 * &#64;SneakyThrow does not silently swallow, wrap into RuntimeException, or otherwise modify any exceptions of the listed
 * checked exception types. The JVM does not check for the consistency of the checked exception system; javac does,
 * and this annotation lets you opt out of its mechanism.
 * <p>
 * Complete documentation is found at <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/SneakyThrows.html">the project lombok features page for &#64;SneakyThrows</a>.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <pre>
 * &#64;SneakyThrows(UnsupportedEncodingException.class)
 * public void utf8ToString(byte[] bytes) {
 *     return new String(bytes, "UTF-8");
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * Becomes:
 * <pre>
 * public void utf8ToString(byte[] bytes) {
 *     try {
 *         return new String(bytes, "UTF-8");
 *     } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException $uniqueName) {
 *         throw useMagicTrickeryToHideThisFromTheCompiler($uniqueName);
 *         // This trickery involves a bytecode transformer run automatically during the final stages of compilation;
 *         // there is no runtime dependency on lombok.
 *     }
 * </pre>

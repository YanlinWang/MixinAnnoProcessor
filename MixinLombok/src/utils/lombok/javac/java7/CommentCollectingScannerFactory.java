			// Context.Factory is parameterized. make() is for javac6 and below; make(Context) is for javac7 and up.
			// this anonymous inner class definition is intentionally 'raw' - the return type of both 'make' methods is 'T',
			// which means the compiler will only generate the correct "real" override method (with returntype Object, which is
			// the lower bound for T, as a synthetic accessor for the make with returntype ScannerFactory) for that make method which
			// is actually on the classpath (either make() for javac6-, or make(Context) for javac7+).
			//
			// We normally solve this issue via src/stubs, with BOTH make methods listed, but for some reason the presence of a stubbed out
			// Context (or even a complete copy, it doesn't matter) results in a really strange eclipse bug, where any mention of any kind
			// of com.sun.tools.javac.tree.TreeMaker in a source file disables ALL usage of 'go to declaration' and auto-complete in the entire
			// source file.
			//
			// Thus, in short:
			// * Do NOT parameterize the anonymous inner class literal.
			// * Leave the return types as 'j.l.Object'.
			// * Leave both make methods intact; deleting one has no effect on javac6- / javac7+, but breaks the other. Hard to test for.
			// * Do not stub com.sun.tools.javac.util.Context or any of its inner types, like Factory.

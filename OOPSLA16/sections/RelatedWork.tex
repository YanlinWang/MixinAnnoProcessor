\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}
In this section we discuss related work and how it compares to Classless Java.

%\yanlin{need to discuss: whether the comments for FTJ is fair.}

%No, was not fair, I know that work, it does modular type checking, and
%more work after that they extend with more safe/modular typing things.
%also, Java8 IS a language extension on Java
%However, language extensions (including FTJ)
%have a natural drawback: the programmer has to learn new syntax. In contrast,
%our approach is completely compatible with the current Java language, so that
%programmers don't need to pay any learning cost to adapt to this new classless
%programming pattern. Another drawback which is particular for FTJ is that FTJ
%doesn't have type for traits, hence the correctness check of trait is done when
%type-checking classes. This choice makes the design of FTJ simpler but lost
%typechecking efficiency (one trait will be potentially checked multiple times if
%it is used in multiple classes).

\paragraph{Multiple Inheritance in Object Oriented Languages}
Many authors have argued in favor or against multiple inheritance.  Multiple
inheritance is very expressive, but difficult to model and implement, and can
cause difficulty (including the famous diamond (fork-join)
problem~\cite{bracha90mixin,Sak89dis}, conflicting methods, etc.) in reasoning about
programs. To conciliate the need for expressive power and simplicity, many
models have been proposed, including C++ virtual inheritance,
mixins~\cite{bracha90mixin}, traits~\cite{scharli03traits}, and hybrid models
such as CZ~\cite{malayeri2009cz}.  They provide novel programming architecture
models in the OO paradigm. In terms of restrictions set on these models, C++
virtual inheritance aims at a relative general model; the mixin model adds some
restrictions; and the trait model is the most restricted one (excluding
state, instantiation, etc).

%\paragraph{C++ Approach.}
C++ tries to provide a general solution to multiple inheritance by
virtual inheritance, dealing with the diamond problem by keeping only
one copy of the base class~\cite{ellis1990annotated}. However C++
suffers from the object initialization problem~\cite{malayeri2009cz}.
It bypasses all constructor calls to virtual superclasses, which can
potentially cause serious semantic errors. In our approach, the \mixin
annotation has full control over object initialization,
and the mechanism is transparent to users. Moreover, customized factory
methods are also allowed: if users are not satisfied with the default
generated \texttt{of} method, they can implement their own.

%\paragraph{Mixins.}
Mixins are a more restricted model than the C++ approach. Mixins allow to name
components that can be applied to various classes as reusable functionality
units. However, % they suffer from linearization: the order of mixin application
% is relevant in often subtle and undesired ways. This hinders their usability
% and the ability of resolving conflicts:
the linearization (total ordering) of
mixin inheritance cannot provide a satisfactory resolution in some cases and
restricts the flexibility of mixin composition. To fight this limitation, an
algebra of mixin operators is introduced~\cite{ancona2002calculus}, but this
raises the complexity, especially when constructors and fields
are considered~\cite{marco09FJigsaw}. Scala traits are in fact more like linearized mixins.
Scala avoids the object initialization
problem by disallowing constructor parameters, causing no ambiguity in cases
such as diamond problem. However this approach has limited expressiveness, and
suffers from all the problems of linearized mixin composition. % Other languages, such as
% Python, also use linearized mixins.
\begin{comment}
Python also offers multiple inheritance via linearized mixins. Indeed, in python any class is implicitly a mixin, and mixin composition informally expressed as\\*
\Q@ class A use B,C {...new methods...}@\\*
can be expressed in python as \\*
\Q@ class Aux: ...new methods...@\\*
\Q@ class A(B,C,Aux): pass@
\end{comment}
\noindent Java interfaces and default methods do not use
linearization: the semantics of Java \textbf{extends} clause in
interfaces is unordered and symmetric.

% However, in pure Java, there is no mechanism for creating objects in
% interfaces. Also, our approach supports proper constructor mechanism.

%\paragraph{CZ.}
Malayeri and Aldrich proposed a model CZ~\cite{malayeri2009cz} which
aims to do multiple inheritance without the diamond problem. They
divide inheritance into two separate concepts: inheritance dependency
and implementation inheritance. Using a combination of
\texttt{requires} and \texttt{extends}, a program with diamond
inheritance can be transformed to one without diamonds. Moreover,
fields and multiple inheritance can coexist. However untangling
inheritance also untangles the class structure. In CZ, not only the
number of classes, but also the class hierarchy complexity
increases. \mixin does not complicate the class structure, and state
can also coexist with multiple inheritance.

%\paragraph{Traits and Java's default methods}
Simplifying the mixins approach, traits~\cite{scharli03traits} draw a strong
line between units of reuse and object factories. Traits, as units of reusable
code, contain only methods as reusable functionality, ignoring state and state
initialization. Classes, as object factories, require functionality from
(multiple) traits. Java 8 interfaces are closely related to
traits: concrete method implementations are allowed (via the \textbf{default}
keyword) inside interfaces. The introduction of default methods opens the gate
for various flavors of multiple inheritance in Java. Traits offer an algebra
of composition operations like sum, alias and exclusion, providing explicit conflict
resolution. Former work~\cite{bono14} provides details on mimicking the trait
algebra through Java 8 interfaces.  We briefly recall the main points of their
encoding; however we propose a different representation of \textbf{exclusion}.
The first author of~\cite{bono14} agreed (via personal communication) that
our revised version for exclusion is cleaner, typesafe and more direct.
\newcommand\shortItem{\vspace{-1ex}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Symmetric sum} can be obtained by simple multiple inheritance between interfaces.
    \begin{lstlisting}
    interface A { int x(); }    interface B { int y(); }    interface C extends A, B {}
    \end{lstlisting}
\shortItem
\item \textbf{Overriding} a conflict is obtained by specifying which super interface take precedence.
    \begin{lstlisting}
    interface A { default int m() {return 1;} }
    interface B { default int m() {return 2;} }
    interface C extends A, B { default int m() {return B.super.m();} }
    \end{lstlisting}
\shortItem
\item \textbf{Alias} is creating  a new method delegating to the existing super interface.
    \begin{lstlisting}
    interface A { default int m() {return 1;} }
    interface B extends A { default int k() {return A.super.m();} }
    \end{lstlisting}
\shortItem

\item \textbf{Exclusion}: exclusion is also supported in Java, where method declarations can hide the default methods correspondingly in the super interfaces.
    \begin{lstlisting}
    interface A { default int m() {return 1;} }
    interface B extends A { int m(); }
    \end{lstlisting}
\shortItem
\end{itemize}

There are also proposals for extending Java with traits. For
example, FeatherTrait Java (FTJ)~\cite{Liquori08ftj} extends
FJ~\cite{Igarashi01FJ} with statically-typed traits, adding trait-based
inheritance in Java.  Except for few, mostly syntactic details, their work can
be emulated with Java 8 interfaces. There are also extensions to the original
trait model, with operations (e.g. renaming~\cite{reppy2006foundation}, which breaks
structural subtyping) that default methods and interfaces cannot
model.

\emph{Traits vs Object Interfaces.}
We consider object interfaces to be an alternative to traits or mixins.  In the
trait model two concepts (traits and classes) coexist and cooperate. Some
authors~\cite{BettiniDSS13} see this as good language design fostering good
software development by helping programmers to think about the structure of
their programs.  However, other authors see the need of two concepts and the
absence of state as drawbacks of this model~\cite{malayeri2009cz}.  Object
interfaces are units of reuse, and at the same time they provide factory methods
for instantiation and support state.  Our approach promotes the use of
interfaces instead of classes, in order to rely on the modular composition
offered by interfaces. Since Java was designed for classes, a direct classless
programming style is verbose and unnatural. However, annotation-driven code
generation is enough to overcome this difficulty, and the resulting programming
style encourages modularity, composability and reusability, by keeping a strong
OO feel. In that sense, we promote object interfaces as being both units of
reusable code and object factories. Our practical experience is that, in Java,
separating the two notions leads to a lot of boilerplate code, and is quite
limiting when multiple inheritance with state is required.  Abstract state
operations avoid the key difficulties associated with multiple inheritance and
state, while still being quite expressive.  Moreover the ability to support
constructors adds expressivity, which is not available in approaches
such as Scala's traits/mixins.

%Nevertheless, we
%believe that in other languages the separation can be more practical
%than in Java, and we do not necessarily advocate that merging the two
%notions is a better approach in general.

%There are other limitations of our current approach, but they may be addressed
%in future work (see Section~\ref{sec:futurework}).


\begin{comment}
Besides, we support more features than the original trait model:
\begin{itemize}
\item We provide \texttt{of} methods for the annotated interfaces. During annotation processing time, the ``fields'' inside an interface are observed and a static method \texttt{of} is automatically injected to the interface with its arguments correspondingly. Such a method is a replacement to the constructors in original traits, making instantiation more convenient to use.
That is, in our approach there are only interfaces, our model requires a single concept, while the trait model requires traits \emph{and} classes.

\item We provide \texttt{with-} methods as auxiliary constructors. A \texttt{with-} method is generated for each field, just like record update, returning the new object with that field updated
%. A \texttt{clone} method is generated for the interface, returning a copy of the current object.
Furthermore, we do automatic return type refinement for this kind of methods. This feature is comparatively useful in big examples, making operations and behaviors more flexible.%, which we will demonstrate later.
\item We provide two options for generating setters. There are two kinds of setters which are commonly used, namely \textit{void setters} and \textit{fluent setters}. The only difference is that a fluent setter returns the object itself after setting, thus supporting a pipeline of such operations. The generation depends on which type of setter is declared in the interface by users.

\paragraph{ThisType and MyType}
%\marco{ this section is unfair. There are unsolved problems with ThisType in negative positions, namely it breaks subtyping. The most common solution is to allow calling some methods only when the exact type is known. This demolishes most advantages of interfaces.}
In certain situations, object interfaces allow automatic refinement for \emph{return
types}. This is part of a bigger topic in class-based languages: expressing and
preserving type recursion and (nominal/structural) subtyping at the same time.

One famous attempt in this direction is provided by
\emph{MyType}~\cite{bruce1994paradigmatic}, representing the type of
\textbf{this}, changing its meaning along with inheritance. However when
invoking a method with MyType in a parameter position, the exact type of the
receiver must be known.  This is a big limitation in class based object oriented
programming, and is exasperated by the interface-based programming we propose: no
type is ever going to be exact since classes are not explicitly used. A recent
article~\cite{Saito2013933} lights up this topic, proposing two
new features: exact statements and nonheritable methods. Both are
related to our work: 1) any method generated inside of the \Q@of@ method is indeed
non-inheritable since there is no class name to extend from; 2) exact
statements (a form of wild-card capture on the exact run-time type) could
capture the ``exact type'' of an object even in a class-less
environment.
Admittedly, MyType greatly enhances the expressiveness and extensibility of
object-oriented programming languages. Object interfaces use covariant-return types to
simulate some uses of MyType. But our approach only works for refining
return types, whereas MyType is more general, as it also works for
parameter types. Nevertheless, as illustrated with our examples and
case studies, object interfaces are still very useful in many
practical applications.
% The addition of MyType to a language will allow easy definition of
%binary methods, methods with recursive types (i.e., the same type of the
%receiver appears in the argument or return positions of methods), etc.


\begin{comment}
\subsection{Type-Directed Translations/Syntactic Sugar}
\marco{I'm tring to merge this and the next one}
Language extensions are often implemented as syntactic sugar of the base
language. For example, Scala compiler supports XML syntax in normal Scala code
directly (after Scala ?, users need to import \texttt{scala-xml} library
manually). However, this approach is hard in terms of implementation, because it
requires extending the compiler. Also, this approach does not support combining
multiple extensions into one.

SugarJ~\cite{erdweg11sugarj} is a Java-based extensible programming language
that allows programmers to extend the base language with custom language
features by definitions in meta-DSLs (SDF, Stratego, etc).
\yanlin{Is new syntax really a ``drawback''? I think for some system, like
  SugarJ, one of purpose IS to introduce these new syntax.}  Drawbacks: new
syntax. To create the extension, programmers have to work with multiple
languages (SDF, stratego, etc) while our approach works totally in Java
environment.

We can model certain types of language extensions with annotations
only, but those extensions do not introduce new syntax: they
merely do automatic code generation.
\end{comment}

\paragraph{Meta-Programming Competes with Language Extensions}
The most obvious solution to adding features to a language is via syntactic
extensions. Syntactic extensions are often implemented as
desugarings to the base language. For example,
the Scala compiler was extended to directly support XML syntax.
However, when syntactic extensions are independently created it is hard
to combine multiple extensions into one.
SugarJ~\cite{erdweg11sugarj} is a Java-based extensible language that
aims at making the creation and composition of syntactic sugar
extensions easy, by allowing programmers to extend Java with custom
features (typically for DSLs). However SugarJ's goals are different
from language tuning: SugarJ aims at creating and composing new syntax;
whereas language tuning merely reinterprets existing syntax. It is
clear that reinterpreting existing syntax only can be limiting
for some applications. However, when language tuning is possible
it has the advantage that existing tools for the language work
out-of-the-box (since the syntax is still the same); and composition
of independently developed tunings is straightforward.

Scala-Virtualized~\cite{Rompf2012scalavirtualized} is an extension to Scala,
which allows blending shallow and deep embedding of DSLs. It redefines
some of Scala's language constructs to method calls,
which can be overridden by DSL implementer. Thus Scala-Virtualized
can also reinterpret syntax, and be seen as a form of language tuning.
However, although many Scala's language constructs are supported,
not all language constructs can be virtualized.

%These extensions are admittedly useful, however they are essentially
%creating a fork of the language, and rarely the new fork gains enough
%traction to become the main language release. % On this
% topic we mention


When the base language has a flexible enough syntax and a fast and
powerful enough reflection mechanism, we may just need to play with
operator overloading and other language tricks to discover that the
language feature we need can be expressed as a simple library in our
language. An example of this is SQLAlchemy~\cite{bayer2012sqlalchemy} in
Python, which uses operator overloading to dynamically turn normal python expressions into database queries
without requiring any syntactic extensions to Python.
Java-like languages tend to sit in the middle of two extremes:
libraries can not influence the type system, so many solutions valid
in Python or other dynamic languages are not applicable, or have the
cost of losing type-safety.

In Java-like languages compile time code generation comes at the rescue: if, for a certain feature
(\mixin in our case), it is possible to use the original language syntax to
\emph{express/describe} any specific instantiation of such feature (annotating a
class and providing getters), then we can insert in the compilation process a tool
that examines and enriches the code before compilation. No need to modify the
original source (for example we can work on temporary files).
Java is a particular
good candidate for this kind of manipulation since it already provide ways to
define and integrate such tools in its own compilation process via annotation
processing. In this way
there is no need of temporary files, and there is a well-defined way of putting
multiple extensions together.

Other languages offer even stronger support for safe code manipulation:
Template Haskell~\cite{sheard2002template}, F\# (type providers)~\footnote{http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/} and MetaFjig (Active Libraries)~\cite{servetto2010metafjig}
all allow to execute code at compile time. They generate code that is
transparently integrated in the program that is being
generated/processed/compiled. In particular, MetaFjig offers a property called
\emph{meta-level-soundness}, ensuring by construction that library code (even if wrong or unreasonable) never generates ill-typed code. This is roughly equivalent to
\textit{Self coherence}, that we have to manually prove.
Since MetaFjig is not working on annotated classes, there is not a ``semantic with/without annotations''. Our \mixin tuning theorem does not make sense in such context.

\paragraph{Formalization of Java 8}
We provide a simple formalization for a subset of Java including
default/static interface methods and object initialization literals
(often called anonymous local inner classes).  A similar formalization
was drafted by Goetz and Field~\cite{goetz12fdefenders} to formalize
defender (default) methods in Java. In their formalization, classes
and interfaces can have only one method \Q@m()@ without arguments, so
as to simplify method overloading and renaming. Classless Java is more
general, as it supports multiple methods with arguments, it supports
static methods, and features such as multiple inheritance of
interfaces and reabstraction of default methods are also modeled.

\bruno{next comes some text that may be handy for related work}

While the motivation for default methods was to allow
interfaces to be extended over time while preserving backwards
compatibility (\emph{interface evolution}), default methods can also
emulate \emph{traits}~\cite{scharli03traits}.  \footnote{The original
  notion of traits by Scharli et al. prescribes, among other things,
  that: 1) a trait provides a set of methods that implement behavior;
  and 2) a trait does not specify any state variables, so the methods
  provided by traits do not access state variables directly. Java 8
  interfaces follow similar principles too. Indeed, a detailed
  description of how to emulate trait-oriented programming in Java 8
  can be found in the work by Bono et al.~\cite{bono14}. The Java 8
  team designing default methods, was also fully aware of that
  secondary use of interfaces, but it was not their objective to model
  traits: ``The key goal of adding default methods to Java was
  "interface evolution", not "poor man's
  traits"''~\cite{goetz13default}. As a result, they were happy to
  support the secondary use of interfaces with default methods as long
  as it did not make the implementation and language more complex.}
\marcoT{We could use Scala Traits to encode IB, but the simpler Java8
  model is a better starting point.}  \footnote{ \marco{may go in
    related work} Scala traits can declare \Q@def, val, var@ and
  \Q@lazy val@ However, while \Q@def@s can be overridden by
  \Q@val@/\Q@var@s, \Q@val@/\Q@var@s can not be overridden.\marco{we
    need to check this} A\Q@val@/\Q@var@ member is predestined to be
  instance state, and this is in sharp contrast with our model where
  the state is only a private detail of instances, and do not
  contaminate interface/trait/classes.}  \footnote{Scala traits have
  no constructor, but \Q@var@s and (\Q@lazy@) \Q@val@s can be
  ``pre-initialized''.}



\section{Interaction of Interface Methods with Interface Composition}
\bruno{I don't think this section makes alot of sense in the context 
of the new paper! I think perhaps some of this could be mentioned 
in related work.

In my opinion, instead of this section, we could have one section 
that demonstrates our implementation and its advantages.

\begin{itemize}

\item Show a diagram of how the approach works? 

\item Syntax and type system reuse; (good for error messages, for example)
\item On-the-fly AST rewriting (means no new files are created, and functionality
is immediatelly available for IDE's for example); this is better than conventional 
annotation processors.
\item Eclipse integration; code completion.
\item No integration issues in typical pre-processors; (the process is transparent; 
no need for an external tool that generates code in a first step).
\item Separate compilation (which relates to the properties?)

\end{itemize}

}
Before formalizing Classless Java and object interfaces, it is helpful
to informally discuss the behaviour of Java8
interfaces, in contrast with conventional trait models.

%We show several interesting cases
%and summarize compilation result of method composition into 3 categories:
%conflict error, accepted (both abstract) and conservative error. Meanwhile we
%also show different composition handling mechanism among traits, javac and ECJ.

\subsection{Methods in Java 8 Interfaces}
In Java 8 interfaces there are three types of methods: abstract, default, and static methods. Default and static methods were not allowed in interfaces in previous versions of Java.

\paragraph{Static methods} are handled in a very clean way: they are visible only in
  the interface in which they are explicitly defined. This means the following code
  is ill-typed.
\begin{lstlisting}
interface A0 { static int m(){return 1;} }
interface B0 extends A0 {}
... B0.m()//ill typed
\end{lstlisting}
This is different from the way static methods are handled in classes. Here
static methods have simply no interaction with interface
composition (\Q@extends@ or \Q@implements@).

\paragraph{Abstract method} composition is accepted when there exists a most specific one.
  For example, here method \texttt{Integer m()} from \texttt{B1} is visible in \Q@C1@.
\begin{lstlisting}
interface A1 { Object m(); }
interface B1 { Integer m();}
interface C1 extends A1,B1 {} //accepted
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Default methods} conflict with any other default or abstract method. For
  example the following code is rejected due to method conflicts.
\begin{lstlisting}
interface A2 { default int m() {return 1;}}
interface B2 { int m(); }
interface C2 { default int m() {return 2;}}
interface D2 extends A2,B2 {} //rejected due to conflicting methods
interface E2 extends A2,C2 {} //rejected due to conflicting methods
\end{lstlisting}
Note how this is different from what happens in most trait models, where \Q@D2@
would be accepted, and the implementation in \Q@A2@ would be part of the
behavior of \Q@D2@.

\paragraph{Resolving conflicts:}
A method in the current interface wins over any method in its
super-interfaces, provided that the method
is the most specific one. This method also overrides conflict due to
inheritance. For example, the following code is accepted, but would be rejected
(see before) if the method \Q@m@ was not redefined in \texttt{D3} and
\texttt{E3}.
\begin{lstlisting}
interface D3 extends A2,B2 { int m(); } //accepted
interface E3 extends A2,C2 { default int m(){return 42;} } //accepted
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Classifying Outcomes of Interface Composition}
%When interfaces are composed and methods with the same name (and
%signature) exist, there are 3 possible outcomes.
%
We now try to classify possible outcomes for composition of methods with the same name (and
signature).
We will use the following (correct) declarations:
\begin{lstlisting}
interface A1 { T m(); }
interface A2 extends A1 { default T m(){ ... } }
interface A3 extends A2 { T m(); }

interface B1 { default T m(){ ... } }
interface B2 extends B1 { T m(); }
interface B3 extends B2 { default T m(){ ... } }
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent
What happens if a new interface \Q@M@ extends one \Q@A@${}_i$ and one
\Q@B@${}_j$?
% Nine representative cases are shown next:\\*
\begin{figure*}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{M extends} & \textbf{A1}                  & \textbf{A2} & \textbf{A3} \\ \hline
\textbf{B1}        & conservative error                     & conflict error      & conservative error       \\ \hline
\textbf{B2}        & both abstract (accepted)     & conservative error       & both abstract (accepted)       \\ \hline
\textbf{B3}        & \textbf{conservative error} &conflict  error       & conservative error      \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{figure*}
%We try to classify the results in the table:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{conflict error} happens when the methods from both interfaces are implemented, which is also an error in most trait models.
\item \textbf{both abstract (accepted)} happens when the methods from both interfaces are abstract, which is also considered correct in all
  trait models.
\item \textbf{conservative error} happens when only one method is implemented
  (leaving another one abstract), which is different from what we would expect in
  a trait model, but is coherent with the conservative idea that a method
  defined in an interface should not silently satisfy a method in another one.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{A bug:} During our experimentation, we found a bug in ECJ (Eclipse compiler for Java):
the case \textbf{M} extending \textbf{B3} and \textbf{A1} is accepted by
ECJ4.5.1 and rejected by javac.  By email communication with Brian Goetz
(leading Java 8 designer) we have confirmed that the expected behavior is
rejection, hence this is a bug in ECJ. This bug was also reported by
  others and is fixed in the ECJ developer branch, but not released as a stable
  version yet.

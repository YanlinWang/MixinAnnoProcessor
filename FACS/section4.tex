\section{Improving Reuse when Subtyping is Impossible}

\name retains the ability to allow reuse even when subtyping is
impossible. That is, in some situations a subclass contains methods
whose signatures are incompatible with the superclass, yet inheritance
is still possible. This type of situations is the primary motivator
for previous work aiming at separating inheritance from subtyping, and
it happens, for example, in classes with \emph{binary
  methods}~\cite{}.  Despite the adoption of a nominal approach and
unlike other nominally typed languages, the leaking problem does not
prevent \name from enjoying such kind of improved reuse.

To illustrate how \name allows for improved reuse, we consider a
pattern to combine \emph{multiple trait inheritance} and \emph{state}:
a challenging problem that has limited the flexibility of traits and
reuse in the past.

\subsection{Managing State}

This idea of summing pieces of code is very elegant, and has proven
very successfull in module composition
languages~\cite{ancona2002calculus}\bruno{and several trait models?}. 
However our research community is
struggling to make it work with object state (constructor and fields)
while acheving the following goals:

\begin{itemize}
\item keep sum associative and commutative,
\item allowing a class to create instances of itself,
\item actually initialize objects, leaving no null fields,
\item managing fields in a way that borrows the elegance of summing methods,
\item make it easy to add new fields.
\end{itemize}

In the related work we will show some alternative ways to handle state.
However the purest solution just requires methods:
  The idea is that
  the trait code just uses getter/setters/factories, while leaving
  to classes the role to finally define the fields/constructors.
  That is, the  the class has syntax richer that the trait one,
  allowing declaration for fields and constructors.
  This approach is very powefull~\cite{wang2016classless}
 
\paragraph*{Advantages:} 
this approach is associative and commutative, even self construction
  can be allowed if the trait requires a static/class method
  returning This; the class will then implement this method by forwarding
  a call to the constructor.
  
\paragraph*{Negatives:} writing the class code with the constructors and
   fields and getter/setters and factories can be quite tedious.
   Moreover, there is no way for a trait to specify a default value for a field,
   the class need to handle all the state, even state that is conceptually
   "private" of such trait.

Here in the following an example of such approach:

\begin{lstlisting}
  pointSum: { method int x()  method int y()
    class method This of(int x,int y)
    method This sum(This other)
      This.of(this.x+other.x,this.y+other.y)
    }
  pointMul: { method int x() method int y()
    class method This of(int x,int y)
    method This mul(This other)
      This.of(this.x*other.x,this.y*other.y)
    }
\end{lstlisting}

As you see, all the state operations are represented as abstract methods.

\subsection{A First Attempt at Composition}
According to the general ideas expressed before,
\begin{lstlisting}
  Point:Use pointSum,pointMul
\end{lstlisting}  

\noindent would fail since methods \Q@x@,\Q@y@ and \Q@of@ are still abstract.
In this mindset, the user would be required to write something similar to

\begin{lstlisting}
  CPoint:Use pointSum,pointMul, {//not our suggested solution
    int x   int y
    method int x()x   method int y()y
    class method This of(int x, int y)
      new Point(x,y)
    constructor Point(int x, int y){ this.x=x   this.y=y }
    }
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent after a while programming in this style, 
writing those obvious ``close the state'' classes become a
repetivie boring job, and one wonder
if it could be possible to automatically generate such code~\cite{wang2016classless}.
Indeed those classes are just a form of ``fixpoint''.

In our model we go one step further: there is no need to generate code, or to explicitly
write down constructors and fields; there is not even syntax for those
constructor.
The idea is that any class that ``could" be completed in the obvious way
\emph{is a complete ``coherent" class}.
In most other languages, a class is abstract if have abstract methods.
Instead, we call abstract a class whose set of abstract methods is not
coherent, that is, can not be automatically recognized as factory,getters and setters.
  
\paragraph*{Detaild definition of coherent:}
\begin{itemize}
\item a class with no abstract method is coherent, and like Java \Q@Math@.
Will just be usefull for calling class/static methods.
\item a class with a single abstract \Q@class@ method returning \Q@This@
is coherent if all the other abstract methods can be seen as \emph{abstract state
operations} over one of its argument.
For example,
if there is a \Q@class method This of(int x, int y)@ as before,
then
\item a method \Q@int x()@ is intepreted as an abstract state method: a getter for \Q@x@.
\item a method \Q@Void x(int that)@ is a setter for x.
\end{itemize}

While getters and setters are fundamental operations, we can immagine
more operations to be supported; for example
\begin{itemize}
\item \Q@method This withX(int that)@
may be a ``wither", doing a functional field update.
\item \Q@method Void update(int x,int y)@
may do two field update at a time.
\item\Q@method This clone()@ may do a shallow clone of the object.
\end{itemize}

We are not sure what is the best set of abstract state operations yet, but we think this could become a very interesting area of research.
  
  
  lets play with the points of before, to see what good can we do with the current
  instruments:

\begin{lstlisting}
 //same code as before for pointSum and pointMul
  pointSum: { method int x() method int y()
    class method This of(int x,int y)
    method This sum(This other)
      This.of(this.x+other.x,this.y+other.y)
    }
  pointMul: { method int x() method int y()//look we are repeating
    class method This of(int x,int y)//the abstract method declarations.
    method This mul(This other)
      This.of(this.x*other.x,this.y*other.y)
    }
  PointAlgebra:Sum pointSum,pointMul
\end{lstlisting}  

  As you can see, we can declare the methods independently and compose the result
  as we wish. However we have to repeat the abstract methods \Q@x@,\Q@y@ and \Q@of@.
  In addition of \Q@Sum@ and \Q@Mul@ we may want many operations over points; can we improve our reuse
  and not repeat such abstract definitions? of course!

\begin{lstlisting}
  p: { method int x() method int y()
    class method This of(int x,int y)
    }
  pointSum:Use p, { method This sum(This other)
      This.of(this.x+other.x,this.y+other.y)
    }
  pointMul:Use p, { method This mul(This other)
      This.of(this.x*other.x,this.y*other.y)
    }
  pointDiv: ...
  PointAlgebra:Use pointSum,pointMul,pointDiv,...
\end{lstlisting}
      
Now our code is fully modularized, and each trait handle exactly one method.

What happens if we want to add fields instead of just operations?

\begin{lstlisting}
  colored:{ method Color color() }
  Point:Sum pointSum,colored //fails
\end{lstlisting}

This first attempt does not work: the abstract color method
is not a getter for any of the parameters of 
\Q@ class method This of(int x,int y)@
A solution is to provide a richer factory:

\begin{lstlisting}
  CPoint:Use pointSum,colored,{
    class method This of(int x,int y) This.of(x,y,Color.of(/*red*/))
    class method This of(int x, int y,Color color)
    }
\end{lstlisting}

where we assume to support overloading on different parameter number.
This is a good solution, we think is better that any alternatives in literature,
however the method \Q@CPoint.sum@ resets the color to red.
What should be the behaviour in this case?
If we support withers, instead of writing \Q@This.of()@ we can use
\Q@this.withX(newX).withY(newY)@ in order to preserve the color from \Q@this@.
Sadly, if we use this design inside of \Q@sum(This other)@ we would loose the color from \Q@other@.

If the point designer could predict this kind of extension, then we could use the following design:  
\begin{lstlisting}
  p: { method int x() method int y()
    method This withX(int that)
    method This withY(int that)
    static method This of(int x,int y)
    method This merge(This other)
    }
  pointSum:Use p, { method This sum(This other)
      this.merge(other).withX(this.x+other.x).withY(this.y+other.y)
    }
  colored:{method Color color()
    method This withColor(Color that)
    method This merge(This other)
      this.withColor(this.color().mix(that.color())
    }
  CPoint:/*as before*/
\end{lstlisting}  
  Now we can merge colors, or any other kind of state we may want to add
  following this pattern.
  In order to compose, let say \Q@colored@ with \Q@flavored@ we would
  need to compose the merge operation inside of both of them.
  The simple model we are presenting could accomodate this with an
  extension allowing code literals inside of a \use\ expression to use some form of super call to compose conflicting implementations. This is similar to the \emph{override} operation present in the original trait model~\cite{ducasse2006traits}.

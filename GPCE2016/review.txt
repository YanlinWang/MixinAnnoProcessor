The paper could be improved by explaining more explicitly what problems are addressed
and what tradeoffs are achieved with this design. In its current form the introduction
is long and a laundry list of concepts and technical details without a clear problem
and only a very vague motivation. Section 2 introduces the language based on a running
example, which is very interesting to follow, but again without introducing a problem
first, so that many points seem not obviously relevant or like side discussions
(e.g., how to instantiate objects or unsatisfactory solutions). Only the related
work section actually discusses conceptual differences and tradeoffs in more detail.
An explicit comparison of concepts regarding certain capabilities, problems, or
goals would position the approach more clearly.

The paper could be improved by making explicit the goal of the evaluation, for example
whether any research questions should be explored or what should be demonstrated.

-- TODO

The paper promises formal definitions and proofs of safety claims in a technical
report, but that report is never referenced and not available in the review system.

-- No???

> Minor comments:


* I was surprised that Cook¡¯s essay (On understanding data abstraction, revisited)
wasn¡¯t mentioned at all; which would be my first thought of programming Java without
classes.

-- TODO

* IB is defined as abbreviation for different long forms and ¡°IB interfaces¡± seems
to be a weird term. In general, consider whether abbreviations are really necessary
or could be removed for readability

-- Not sure

* Avoid hiding own prior work behind passive voice ([26])

-- Really?

* Multiple inheritance is a key focus but the diamond problem is never discussed
until related work and it is not clearly explained how Java default methods solve
the problem. For example, how would you resolve if Bird, Horse both had a method
¡°sleep()¡± with different implementations?

-- ???

* There seems to be a lot of semantics and magic tied to naming conventions, for
example detecting methods starting with ¡°with¡±, without ever discussing potential
drawbacks of such approach; also why does the paper not follow Java¡¯s normal conventions
for naming getters and setters?

-- Should we do that?

* Expansion of mutable state is never shown
* Why are fields representing immutable state not final?
* With the order of extended interfaces undefined, how is the order of variables
in the constructor determined?

-- TODO

* The limitations especially regarding having to define all interfaces within a single
file seem quite severe

-- We don't have a solution yet

with- methods would work for an object having only a few fields
but not for an object having many fields.  If a Point object has
four fields x, y, z, w, then programmers might want to use methods
like withXandY(int x_val, int y_val).  Can @Obj produce with-methods
for all possible combinations of fields?  (The reviewer later noticed
that with- methods are sort of setters.  Maybe some notes should be
added at the first paragraph where with-methods appear.)

-- ???

Maybe the description of @Obj in this paper could be improved.  The
reviewer is still unsure of some corner cases.  Some summary (or
formal definition?) would help.

-- We do have formal definition, yet in appendix

Classless Java seems to support only diamond inheritance, where
a field declared in a common super interface is unique.  It might
be a drawback.

-- ???

The reviewer is wondering what are differences between traits and
object interfaces.  Classless Java's code generator invoked by @Obj
can be regarded as a system generating a class inheriting from several
traits (= interfaces in Classless Java).  Is this automatic class
generation by @Obj (considering type refinement) only a unique feature
against traits?

-- ???

> The reviewer's understanding is that if you have the following class:

> interface A {
>   A child();
>   A child2();
> }

> interface B extends A {
>   B child2();
> }

Then, B.of().child() also returns an instance of B.  But child() may
have to keep returning an instance of A.  The reviewer supposes that
the authors assume that, if a subinterface of A is defined, A is never
instantiated (A is considered as an abstract class as in OOP).  This
might be a problem in some cases.  The reviewer might miss something
but the semantics of the type refinement should be presented more
clearly.

-- TODO


> Section 3.2.Client coherence.

This paragraph mentions that the well-typed code before code
generation ... When are "of" methods available?  After code
generation?  Do the authors mean in this paragraph that, if the code
that does not call "of" methods is well typed, then ...?
I suppose that the code calling "of" methods are not well-typed
before code generation since "of" methods are added after that.
Is this correct?

-- To clarify

Section 4.4.
The last paragraph mentions that the code in the refactored version
is slightly increased.  Why?

> ----------- Review -----------
> The paper presents classless Java, a technique for providing type inheritance by
>  only using interfaces for programming. State is encoded by providing appropriate
>  getter and setter methods, so-called abstract state operations. Behaviour is encoded
>  through default methods. Instantiation is performed through factory methods. All
>  actual fields and factory methods as well as the implementations of setters and
>  getters are generated through an annotation processor. The authors claim that this
>  approach to object-oriented programming, which they also call interface-based oo
>  programming, improves flexibility and modularity, enabling multiple inheritance
>  and solving the expression problem.

> Overall, the paper presents an interesting novel approach to OO programming and,
>  as such, is well worth presenting at GPCE. My main critique of the paper concerns
>  (1) the clarity of the presentation, and (2) the evaluation of the work:

(1) Presentation: Throughout, there a numerous points where it is difficult to follow
the ideas of the paper. Perhaps the biggest one is Sect. 2.5, where it is simply
stated that multiple inheritance now works, but no explanation is given as to why.
In fact, it is easy to imagine a scenario where multiple sub-classes of, say, Point2D
provide different refinements, and, thus, different implementations of with(Point2D).
What happens in such a case if a new interface extends more than one of these sub-classes?

-- TODO

There are other, lesser, issues of this kind, too: For example, it is not clear how
precisely with-methods are to be declared. On page 3 it appears as if they are recognised
based on a naming convention (withXYZ, where XYZ is the name of the attribute).
On page 4, there a new kind of naming convention is implicitly introduced. However,
on page 8 all assumptions about naming conventions are broken when select, from,
and where are essentially used like with-methods with the assertion that their implementation
will be automatically generated (quite apart from the fact that this seems an awful
performance waste when the corresponding attributes could simply be considered mutable).

-- On page 8 they are fluent setters, not withers. TODO

On page 4, mutable state is introduced, but it is never explained how this is handled
in the generated code. It is unclear to me, for example, whether there is a way
to implement some more logic into the setters (so that, for example, notifications
could be sent when an attribute value changes) or whether the internal data structures
are all too well hidden for this.

-- ??? to clarify

(2) Evaluation: The evaluation provided consists, essentially, of some examples presented.
While this is nice in that it gives a more complete picture of how one would use
the new approach, it does not provide many insights into its capabilities and limitations.
For example, the authors discuss the reduction in code to be written, but this information
is less useful unless there is also some information about how the new style affects
understandability, maintainability, etc. Similarly, the limitations of the support
for multiple inheritance etc. are not systematically explored, making it difficult
for the reader to judge the range of applicability of the new approach.

-- TODO

> Minor comments:

- the choice of "wither" in similarity to "getter" and "setter" seems a little bit
unlucky as this parses as a synonym for "wilt"/"decay"/"die"

-- ???

- page 2, left column: "As a result, we experiment object interfaces with several
interesting Java programs and conduct various case studies." didn't parse. I suspect
that "experiment" is the wrong choice of word here, but am not sure what the authors
intended to say.

-- TODO

- Is the implementation of the annotation processor available somewhere?

-- add footnote for that

%In this section we discuss related work and how it compares to Classless Java.

%\yanlin{need to discuss: whether the comments for FTJ is fair.}

%No, was not fair, I know that work, it does modular type checking, and
%more work after that they extend with more safe/modular typing things.
%also, Java8 IS a language extension on Java
%However, language extensions (including FTJ)
%have a natural drawback: the programmer has to learn new syntax. In contrast,
%our approach is completely compatible with the current Java language, so that
%programmers don't need to pay any learning cost to adapt to this new classless
%programming pattern. Another drawback which is particular for FTJ is that FTJ
%doesn't have type for traits, hence the correctness check of trait is done when
%type-checking classes. This choice makes the design of FTJ simpler but lost
%typechecking efficiency (one trait will be potentially checked multiple times if
%it is used in multiple classes).

\paragraph{Models of \objectoriented programming}
There are traditionally two big styles of OOP: \classbased and
\prototypebased. The \classbased tradition started with Simula~\cite{Dahl66simula},
and is the dominant style of OOP today. Major languages such
as Java, C\#, C++ or Scala favour a \classbased OOP style. Very often
\classbased languages are statically typed and they have interfaces or
some other similar mechanisms such as traits. However, in contrast to
IB, interfaces or traits in CB are not meant to
replace classes, but rather, they complement classes. Normally
interfaces or traits define the signatures of the methods and
\emph{may} have some behavior (such as in Java 8 interfaces or Scala
traits). However classes are still responsible for object
instantiation and handling state. \Prototypebased languages started
with Self~\cite{Ungar87self} and are still widely used today via languages like
JavaScript. Frequently \prototypebased languages are dynamically
typed. IB is clearly closer to CB. However the
key difference is that classes are not needed in IB. Object interfaces recover the responsibility of object
instantiation, and abstract state operations provide a way to deal
with state. A primary motivation of IB is to improve
modularity and flexibility. Central to these goals are the
more expressive and automated forms of type-refinement, and support
for multiple interface inheritance.

\para{Multiple inheritance in \objectoriented languages}
Many authors have argued in favor or against multiple inheritance.
Multiple \emph{implementation}
inheritance is very expressive, but difficult to model and implement. It can
cause difficulties (including the famous diamond
problem~\cite{bracha90mixin,Sak89dis}, conflicting methods, etc.) in reasoning about
programs. To allow for expressive power and simplicity, many
models have been proposed, including C++ virtual inheritance,
mixins~\cite{bracha90mixin}, traits~\cite{scharli03traits}, and hybrid models
such as CZ~\cite{malayeri2009cz}.  They provide novel programming architecture
models in the OO paradigm. In terms of restrictions set on these models, C++
virtual inheritance aims at a relative general model; the mixin model adds some
restrictions; and the trait model is the most restricted one (excluding
state, instantiation, etc).

%\paragraph{C++ Approach.}
C++ has a general solution to multiple inheritance by
virtual inheritance, dealing with the diamond problem by keeping only
one copy of the base class~\cite{ellis1990annotated}. However it
suffers from object initialization problem~\cite{malayeri2009cz}.
It bypasses constructor calls to virtual superclasses, which can
cause serious semantic errors. In our approach, the \mixin
annotation has full control over object initialization,
and the mechanism is transparent to users. If users are not satisfied with the default
 \texttt{of} method, customized factory methods can be provided.

%\paragraph{Mixins.}
Mixins are more restricted than the C++ approach. Mixins allow naming
components that can be applied to various classes as reusable functionality
units. However, % they suffer from linearization: the order of mixin application
% is relevant in often subtle and undesired ways. This hinders their usability
% and the ability of resolving conflicts:
the linearization (total ordering) of
mixin inheritance cannot provide a satisfactory resolution in some cases and
restricts the flexibility of mixin composition. To fight against this limitation, an
algebra of mixin operators is introduced~\cite{ancona2002calculus}, but this
raises the complexity, especially when constructors and fields
are considered~\cite{marco09FJigsaw}. Scala traits~\cite{scala-overview} are in fact more like linearized mixins.
Scala avoids the object initialization
problem by disallowing constructor parameters, causing no ambiguity in cases
such as the diamond problem. However this approach has limited expressiveness, and
suffers from all the problems of linearized mixin composition. % Other languages, such as
% Python, also use linearized mixins.
\begin{comment}
Python also offers multiple inheritance via linearized mixins. Indeed, in python any class is implicitly a mixin, and mixin composition informally expressed as\\*
\Q@ class A use B,C {...new methods...}@\\*
can be expressed in python as \\*
\Q@ class Aux: ...new methods...@\\*
\Q@ class A(B,C,Aux): pass@
\end{comment}
\noindent Java interfaces and default methods do not use
linearization: the semantics of Java \textbf{extends} clause in
interfaces is unordered and symmetric.

% However, in pure Java, there is no mechanism for creating objects in
% interfaces. Also, our approach supports proper constructor mechanism.

%\paragraph{CZ.}
Malayeri and Aldrich proposed a model CZ~\cite{malayeri2009cz} which
aims to do multiple inheritance without the diamond problem.
Inheritance is divided into two concepts: inheritance dependency
and implementation inheritance. Using a combination of
\texttt{requires} and \texttt{extends}, a program with diamond
inheritance is transformed to one without diamonds. Moreover,
fields and multiple inheritance can coexist. However untangling
inheritance also untangles the class structure. In CZ, not only the
number of classes, but also the class hierarchy complexity
increases. IB does not complicate the hierarchical structure, and state
also coexists with multiple inheritance.

%\paragraph{Traits and Java's default methods}
Simplifying the mixins approach, traits~\cite{scharli03traits} draw a strong
line between units of reuse and object factories. Traits, as units of reusable
code, contain only methods as reusable functionality, ignoring state and state
initialization. Classes, as object factories, require functionality from
(multiple) traits. Java 8 interfaces are closely related to
traits: concrete method implementations are allowed (via the \textbf{default}
keyword) inside interfaces. The introduction of default methods opens the gate
for various flavors of multiple inheritance in Java. Traits offer an algebra
of composition operations like sum, alias, and exclusion, providing explicit conflict
resolution. Former work~\cite{bono14} provides details on mimicking the trait
algebra through Java 8 interfaces.
\begin{comment}
We briefly recall the main points of their
encoding; however we propose a different representation of \textbf{exclusion}.
The first author of~\cite{bono14} agreed (via personal communication) that
our revised version for exclusion is cleaner, typesafe and more direct.
\newcommand\shortItem{\vspace{-1ex}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Symmetric sum} can be obtained by simple multiple inheritance between interfaces.
    \begin{lstlisting}
    interface A { int x(); }
    interface B { int y(); }
    interface C extends A, B {}
    \end{lstlisting}
\shortItem
\item \textbf{Overriding} a conflict is obtained by specifying which super interface take precedence.
    \begin{lstlisting}
    interface A { default int m() {return 1;} }
    interface B { default int m() {return 2;} }
    interface C extends A, B {
        default int m() {return B.super.m();} }
    \end{lstlisting}
\shortItem
\item \textbf{Alias} is creating  a new method delegating to the existing super interface.
    \begin{lstlisting}
    interface A { default int m() {return 1;} }
    interface B extends A {
        default int k() {return A.super.m();} }
    \end{lstlisting}
\shortItem

\item \textbf{Exclusion}: exclusion is also supported in Java, where method declarations can hide the default methods correspondingly in the super interfaces.
    \begin{lstlisting}
    interface A { default int m() {return 1;} }
    interface B extends A { int m(); }
    \end{lstlisting}
\shortItem
\end{itemize}
\end{comment}
There are also proposals for extending Java with traits. For
example, FeatherTrait Java (FTJ)~\cite{Liquori08ftj} extends
FJ~\cite{Igarashi01FJ} with statically-typed traits, adding trait-based
inheritance in Java.  Except for few, mostly syntactic details, their work can
be emulated with Java 8 interfaces. There are also extensions to the original
trait model, with operations (e.g. renaming~\cite{reppy2006foundation}, which breaks
structural subtyping) that default methods and interfaces cannot
model.

\para{Traits vs object interfaces.}
We consider object interfaces an alternative to traits or mixins. In
trait model two concepts (traits and classes) coexist and cooperate. Some
authors~\cite{BettiniDSS13} see this as good language design fostering good
software development by helping programmers think about the program structures.
However, others see the need of two concepts and the
absence of state as drawbacks of this model~\cite{malayeri2009cz}.  Object
interfaces are units of reuse, and meanwhile provide factory methods
for instantiation and support state. Our approach promotes the use of
interfaces in order to exploit the modular composition
offered by interfaces. Since Java was designed for classes, a direct classless
programming style is verbose and unnatural. However, annotation-driven code
generation is enough to overcome this difficulty and the resulting programming
style encourages modularity, composability and reusability. %, by keeping a strong OO feel.
In that sense, we promote object interfaces as being both units of
reuse and object factories. Our practical experience shows that
separating the two notions leads to lots of boilerplate code, and is quite
limiting when multiple inheritance with state is required.  Abstract state
operations avoid the key difficulties associated with multiple inheritance and
state, while still being quite expressive. Moreover the ability to support
constructors adds expressivity, which is not available in approaches
such as Scala's traits/mixins.
%\footnote{Scala traits have
%  no constructor, but \Q@var@s and (\Q@lazy@) \Q@val@s can be
%  ``pre-initialized''.}

%Nevertheless, we
%believe that in other languages the separation can be more practical
%than in Java, and we do not necessarily advocate that merging the two
%notions is a better approach in general.

%There are other limitations of our current approach, but they may be addressed
%in future work (see Section~\ref{sec:futurework}).



% \footnote{The original
%  notion of traits by Scharli et al. prescribes, among other things,
%  that: 1) a trait provides a set of methods that implement behavior;
%  and 2) a trait does not specify any state variables, so the methods
%  provided by traits do not access state variables directly. Java 8
%  interfaces follow similar principles too. Indeed, a detailed
%  description of how to emulate trait-oriented programming in Java 8
%  can be found in the work by Bono et al.~\cite{bono14}. The Java 8
%  team designing default methods, was also fully aware of that
%  secondary use of interfaces, but it was not their objective to model
%  traits: ``The key goal of adding default methods to Java was
%  "interface evolution", not "poor man's
%  traits"''~\cite{goetz13default}. As a result, they were happy to
%  support the secondary use of interfaces with default methods as long
%  as it did not make the implementation and language more complex.}

\begin{comment}
\marcoT{We could use Scala Traits to encode IB, but the simpler Java8
  model is a better starting point: scala traits can declare \Q@def, val, var@ and
  \Q@lazy val@ However, while \Q@def@s can be overridden by
  \Q@val@/\Q@var@s, \Q@val@/\Q@var@s can not be overridden.
   A\Q@val@/\Q@var@ member is predestined to be
  instance state, and this is in sharp contrast with our model where
  the state is only a private detail of instances, and do not
  contaminate interface/trait/classes.
  }
\end{comment}




\begin{comment}
Besides, we support more features than the original trait model:
\begin{itemize}
\item We provide \texttt{of} methods for the annotated interfaces. During annotation processing time, the ``fields'' inside an interface are observed and a static method \texttt{of} is automatically injected to the interface with its arguments correspondingly. Such a method is a replacement to the constructors in original traits, making instantiation more convenient to use.
That is, in our approach there are only interfaces, our model requires a single concept, while the trait model requires traits \emph{and} classes.

\item We provide \texttt{with-} methods as auxiliary constructors. A \texttt{with-} method is generated for each field, just like record update, returning the new object with that field updated
%. A \texttt{clone} method is generated for the interface, returning a copy of the current object.
Furthermore, we do automatic return type refinement for this kind of methods. This feature is comparatively useful in big examples, making operations and behaviors more flexible.%, which we will demonstrate later.
\item We provide two options for generating setters. There are two kinds of setters which are commonly used, namely \textit{void setters} and \textit{fluent setters}. The only difference is that a fluent setter returns the object itself after setting, thus supporting a pipeline of such operations. The generation depends on which type of setter is declared in the interface by users.

is an old idea used in languages such as
Self~\cite{Ungar1987self}, Dart~\cite{Dart} and Newspeak~\cite{Bracha_thenewspeak}.
% By declaring fields in Newspeak and other languages,
The programmers specifies field signatures and (critically) the intention of storing such information,
then the language generates getters and setters.
Once state is abstracted away, it is well known that state
access can be replaced with computation, but the type of the field stays the same.
We do the opposite, the idea of the field is generated starting from signatures of
getters and setters. % Our fluid approach to state is specular:
In our approach, the intention of storing the information is not expressed by the programmer and set in stone
but can vary by inheritance.
In this case, the underlying type of the field can be changed by our fluid state,

\para{ThisType and MyType}
%\marco{ this section is unfair. There are unsolved problems with ThisType in negative positions, namely it breaks subtyping. The most common solution is to allow calling some methods only when the exact type is known. This demolishes most advantages of interfaces.}
Object interfaces support automatic type-refinement.
Type refinement is part of a bigger topic in \classbased languages: expressing and
preserving type recursion and (nominal/structural) subtyping at the same time.
One famous attempt in this direction is
\emph{MyType}~\cite{bruce1994paradigmatic}, representing the type of
\textbf{this}, changing its meaning along with inheritance. However when
invoking a method with MyType in parameter positions, the exact type of the
receiver must be known. This is a big limitation in \classbased OO
programming and is exasperated by the \interfacebased programming we propose: no
type is ever going to be exact since classes are not explicitly used. A recent
article~\cite{Saito2013933} proposes two
new features: exact statements and nonheritable methods. Both are
related to our work: 1) any method generated inside the \Q@of@ method is indeed
non-inheritable since there is no class name to extend from; 2) exact
statements (a form of wild-card capture on the exact run-time type) could
capture the ``exact type'' of an object even in a class-less
environment.
Admittedly, MyType greatly enhances the expressivity and extensibility of
\objectoriented programming languages. Object interfaces %use covariant-return types to
simulate some uses of MyType. But this approach only works for refining
return types, whereas MyType is more general, as it also works for
parameter types. Our approach to covariantly refine state can recover
some of the additional expressivity of MyType. As illustrated with our examples, object interfaces are still very useful in many
practical applications, yet they do not require additional
complexity from the type system.

% The addition of MyType to a language will allow easy definition of
%binary methods, methods with recursive types (i.e., the same type of the
%receiver appears in the argument or return positions of methods), etc.

\paragraph{Comparison with other Lombok annotations}\marco{if we keep it, will go in related work}
The Lombok project provides a set of predefined annotations, including constructor
generators similar as ours (e.g., \Q:@NoArgsConstructor:,
\Q:@RequiredArgsConstructor: and \Q:@AllArgsConstructor:). They
generate various kinds of constructors for \emph{classes}, with or without
constructor arguments. This set of annotations is of great use, especially when
used together with other features provided in Lombok (e.g.,
\Q:@Data:). Moreover, the implementation of these annotations in Lombok
gives us hints on how to implement \mixin. However, none of these annotations
can model what we are doing with \mixin - generating constructor-methods
(\textbf{of}) for \emph{interfaces}. Apart from constructors, \mixin also
provides other convenient features (including generating fluent setters, type
refinement, etc), which the base Lombok project does not provide.
Finally, while \mixin is formalized, none of Lombok's annotations have been
studied in a formal way.



\subsection{Type-Directed Translations/Syntactic Sugar}
\marco{I'm tring to merge this and the next one}
Language extensions are often implemented as syntactic sugar of the base
language. For example, Scala compiler supports XML syntax in normal Scala code
directly (after Scala ?, users need to import \texttt{scala-xml} library
manually). However, this approach is hard in terms of implementation, because it
requires extending the compiler. Also, this approach does not support combining
multiple extensions into one.

SugarJ~\cite{erdweg11sugarj} is a Java-based extensible programming language
that allows programmers to extend the base language with custom language
features by definitions in meta-DSLs (SDF, Stratego, etc).
\yanlin{Is new syntax really a ``drawback''? I think for some system, like
  SugarJ, one of purpose IS to introduce these new syntax.}  Drawbacks: new
syntax. To create the extension, programmers have to work with multiple
languages (SDF, stratego, etc) while our approach works totally in Java
environment.

We can model certain types of language extensions with annotations
only, but those extensions do not introduce new syntax: they
merely do automatic code generation.

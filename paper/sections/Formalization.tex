\section{Formal Semantics}\label{sec:typesafety}
Yanlin and Haoyuan

We need to show 2 things:

1) The dynamic semantics: what's the code that gets generated by a mixin annotation;

2) The type system: what programs to reject; properties: generation of type-safe/checkable code.

\bruno{The implementation is still missing the type system (rejecting some programs)!}

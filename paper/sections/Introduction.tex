\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

\begin{itemize}

\item Using annotattions to implement a rich notion of traits with a
mechanism to instantiate objects (the of method). Goal 1: is to reduce
the amount of code that is required to program with interfaces and default
methods. Goal 2: To provide a convenient means to do multiple inheritance
in Java.

\item Specify the system more formally.

\item Show that we can model all trait operations

\item Implementation using Lombok

\item Case studies: The expression problem, Trivially
Case Studies from traits paper.

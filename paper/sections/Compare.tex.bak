\section{Comparing to traits and mixins}
Haoyuan

   - vs both: we do automatic return type refinement, which has useful applications
   (example: Expression Problem)

   - vs traits: we support of methods to create new objects (a replacement to constructors);
   Moreover we have the with and clone methods (we miss more applications for those). Show
   how to model the operations on traits; discuss operations that we cannot model
   (example: renaming).

   - vs mixins: we use the trait model of explicitly resolving conflicts. This is arguably
   better for reasoning.
